          <p>
            It's summer and you were thinking of making a round-trip of your country. There is one problem: You're still a student and that ain't be cheap.
            You have two options:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>You ask your friends for extra money <i>or</i></li>
              <li>You shorten your trips as much as possible.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually, let's do a small poll.
            <div class="strawpoll-embed" id="strawpoll_1MnwkP385n7" style="height: 480px; max-width: 640px; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><iframe title="StrawPoll Embed" id="strawpoll_iframe_1MnwkP385n7" src="https://strawpoll.com/embed/1MnwkP385n7" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 100%; flex-grow: 1;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allowtransparency>Loading...</iframe><script async src="https://cdn.strawpoll.com/dist/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

            Ok, so if you opted for (a), maybe this blog post will be boring for you <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#128564;</span>.
            But If you opted for (b), you'll probably enjoy what follows.
          </p>
          
          
          <br />
          <h3>Traveling Salesman Problem</h3>
          <p>
            The problem of having the <i>shortest</i> trip - so what you choose by (b) - is also known as the Traveling Salesmen Problem (probably you knew this, otherwise you wouldn't have landed on this post).
            The "formal" definition would be:
          </p>
            <div class="box">
              <p><i>Given a list of your favorite cities and the distances between these, what is the shortest trip so that each city is visited exactly once and you return to your home city?</i></p>
            </div>
          <p>
              While there are multiple ways to go about solving this (see <a href="https://medium.com/basecs/speeding-up-the-traveling-salesman-using-dynamic-programming-b76d7552e8dd">here</a> for a nice Medium post), we'll focus on the dynamic programming solution. This is also what you saw in the xkcd at the beginning.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h3>The Dynamic Programming Solution</h3>
          <p>
            If you're into algorithms / computer science, you've probably seen this in your introductory courses. It's an algorithm devised in 1962 by Bellman, and independently by Held and Karp. The algorithm goes as follows:
            You have a dynamic programming (DP) table $\mathrm{dp}$ that is indexed by subsets of the cities <i>and</i> by the last city visited in the subset.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let's outline the DP-recursion. In the following, let $n$ be the number of cities $c$ be the $n\times n$ cost matrix, so $c(i, j)$ is the distance between cities $i$ and $j$. Then, 
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p>
              $\begin{align}
                \mathrm{dp}(S, k) &= \displaystyle\min_{j \in S \setminus \{k\}}\left(\mathrm{dp}(S \setminus \{k\}, j) + c_{j,k}\right), k \in S\\
                \mathrm{dp}(\{1\}, 1) &= 0,
              \end{align}$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            where $S \subseteq [n] := \{1, \ldots, n\}$. At the end, the final solution is computed as
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <p>
                $\displaystyle\min_{j}\left(\mathrm{dp}([n], j) + c_{j,1}\right)$.
              </p>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            A convenient way to compute the $\mathrm{dp}$-table is to fix a cardinality $\ell \in \{2, \ldots, n\}$ and compute the $\mathrm{dp}$-values for all sets of cardinality $\ell$.
            In other words, the $\mathrm{dp}$-table is computed <i>layer-wise</i>.
          </p>
          <h4>Running Time</h4>
            <p>
              The algorithm runs in time $O(2^n n^2)$, since for each state $(S, k)$ we have to loop over all $j$ in $S \setminus \{k\}$.
              You'd be surprised to learn that, apart from some special TSP instances, this is the best we can do for the general case.
            <br />
            <br />
            Better said, this <i>was</i> the best we could do. Next, we show how you can actually boost this.
          </p>
          
          <br />
          <h3>Another Perspective</h3>

          <p>
            Let's take a step back and contemplate the equation that consumed 1/2 of your time in high-school:
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <p>
                $C_{i,j} = \displaystyle\sum_{k} A_{i,k} B_{k,j}$.
              </p>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            You probably don't need an explanation what this stands for. Now, regard again the DP-recursion for TSP. Then again this equation. <i>Do you see any pattern?</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>"Wait, is the DP-recursion a matrix multiplication?</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Indeed, the shape of the DP-recursion resembles that of a matrix multiplication. Namely, the entry $\mathrm{dp}(S \setminus \{k\}, j)$ interacts with the entry $c_{j,k}$. This is nothing else but a matrix multiplication in the $(\min, +)$ semi-ring. Ok, this notation might raise some questions. So we've all been used to the $(+, \times)$ ring, where you multiply the entries and then sum the products. In the $(\min, +)$ semi-ring, instead of multiplying the entries you add them and take the minimum of these.
            Formally a matrix multiplication (product) in the $(\min, +)$ semi-ring is defined as:
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <p>
                $C_{i,j} = \displaystyle\min_{k}\:(A_{i,k} + B_{k,j})$.
              </p>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you paid attention, computing $\mathrm{dp}(S, k)$ is not exactly a matrix product, but a vector inner-product in the $(\min, +)$ semi-ring between the DP-row $\mathrm{dp}(S \setminus \{k\}, :)$ and the column $c_{:, k}$ of the cost matrix.
            To actually get the matrix product we want, we just need to group multiple rows of the last layer of the DP-table, put them into many square matrices, and take their product with the cost matrix. And that's it.
            <br />
            <br />
            You probably wonder why we need all this. Well, what if I told you that matrix products in the $(\min, +)$ semi-ring can be done <i>faster than the naive $O(n^3)$ algorithm</i>?
          </p>

          <br />
          <h3>The New Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            So we just saw that, actually, the standard Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm is doing naively the min-plus matrix product between the previous layer of the DP-table and the cost matrix.
            For compliance with the existing algorithms on min-plus matrix products, we group the DP-rows of the previous layer so to have only square matrices.

          </p>
          <h4>Running Time</h4>
          <p>
            You may ask: <i>But does this change the time-complexity?</i>

            At a first sight, the new perspective just computes the new DP-layer in another, different manner. So if a min-plus product between two $n\times n$-matrices takes $T(n)$ time, then our new algorithm takes time
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <p>
                $O(\frac{2^n}{n} T(n))$.
              </p>
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            If we use the naive algorithm for the min-plus matrix product, that is $T(n) = O(n^3)$, we're still in the regime of $O(2^n n^2)$.
            So the question is:
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <p>            
                <i>Are there faster algorithms for this kind of product?</i>
              </p>
            </div>
          </p>
          <h4>Min-Plus Matrix Product</h4>
          <p>
            Fortunately for us, there has been a long line of research on this problem.
            Research on faster min-plus matrix product has already started in the 1976 with Fredman's work on All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), which is in itself very interesting problem in algorithmic design.
            The fastest algorithm is due to Williams and runs in the following (very complicated looking) term:
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <p>
                $n^3 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$.
              </p>
            </div>
          </p>

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>
            Combining the last parts, we thus obtain an $O(2^n n^2 / 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})})$-time algorithm for TSP. This improves over the decades old algorithm taught in every lecture since the 60's.
